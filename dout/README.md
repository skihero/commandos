Find the IP given a host pattern and the domain 
===============================================


Usage:  
-----------
dout domain host_pattern 


How it works: 
-------------- 

The script does a dig for the machines with host pattern and 
the domain name. 


The host pattern now is a substring, that will be expanded 
to substring1,..,..,substringN.  These are collected in a 
file and processed using dig.
