<p>I have stacks of collections of science-fiction short stories. I grab these before getting on a long flight, so if a story is just unreadable, I have 20 others to try. Asimov was one of my favorites, and I still love his books. They were my go-to as a 10-year-old (which is still my normal mental state).</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://geni.us/1nwUD"><i>LoveStar </i></a>by Andri Snaer Magnason</strong></p>
<p>This novel by Icelandic writer Magnason is set in the future when technology has been entrusted with many aspects of human interaction, including identifying and bringing together soulmates, while “unscientifically validated relationships” are callously wrecked. Young, blissfully-in-love couple Indridi and Sigrid have their perfect lives threatened, along with Indridi’s sanity, when they are “calculated apart” and forced to go to extreme lengths to prove their love. A suspenseful and inspiring novel about man vs. machine, the imperfections that make us human, and what it is that really matters in life.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://geni.us/4gjdBg"><i>A Hundred Thousand Hours</i></a> by Gro Dahle, translation by Rebecca Wadlinger</strong></p>
<p>This is a book of poetry by an acclaimed Norwegian poet &#8212; but unless you speak Norwegian, you&#8217;ve probably never heard of her. To my knowledge this is the only book of hers to be translated into English. The poetry is emotionally resonant, strange and surreal in the best way, and it feels both accessible and fresh.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://geni.us/o6zOGu"><i>Elizabeth Street</i></a> by Laurie Fabiano</strong></p>
<p>I enjoyed reading this historical novel that was based on true events. It gave me a vivid sense of what it was like to live in New York City in the early 1900s as an Italian immigrant &#8212; and what it may have been like to be targeted by the Black Hand, the precursor to the Mafia.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://geni.us/XDJzY"><i>The Ordering of Love: The New &amp; Collected Poems of Madeleine L’Engle</i></a> by Madeleine L&#8217;Engle</strong></p>
<p>L&#8217;Engle is best known for her award-winning children&#8217;s literature, but I enjoy all of her books. This collection is a book I return to in every season of my life as she ponders love, purpose, loss, faith, history and humanity.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m re-reading my favorite gothic horror book in its original French format. Leroux was a popular mystery author in the early 1900s. The book is far from Andrew Lloyd Webber’s romanticized musical version, and it’s frightening in the most compelling way.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://geni.us/KsyS"><i>Version Contro</i><em>l</em></a> by Dexter Palmer</strong></p>
<p>This novel treads a fine line between modern literature and science fiction, perfectly adapting the evocative prose and mystery of one and the excitement and uncertainty of the other. Primarily following the middle-age crisis of Rebecca &#8212; a woman who feels something is deeply wrong with her universe &#8212; the book explores whether her ennui is caused by the banality of modern life, a mysterious family tragedy or something that’s gone terribly wrong with her physicist husband&#8217;s &#8220;causality violation&#8221; experiment. While it&#8217;s set in a not-too-distant future of autonomous cars, pervasive social networking and online dating, the struggles of the characters to find meaning, purpose and love are timeless.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://geni.us/YiOt0J"><i>Deep Down Dark: The Untold Stories of 33 Men Buried in a Chilean Mine, and the Miracle That Set Them Free</i></a> by Héctor Tobar</strong></p>
<p>In the tradition of books like <i>Alive</i> and <i>In Cold Blood</i>, <i>Deep Down Dark</i> is a nonfiction account that reads like a novel. Tobar tells the story of 33 Chilean miners trapped underground for more than two months at the San Jose Mine. What makes the book so riveting is how he manages to capture both the detailed (and fascinating) logistics of staying alive and the fear and longing that shapes both their survival and their subsequent celebrity.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://geni.us/NR1i3v1"><i>Multiple Choice</i></a> by Alejandro Zambra</strong></p>
<p>This seriously playful book, by one of the brightest young stars in the Latin American literary firmament, defies categorization. It calls on the reader to make parts of its narrative disappear. The book subtly alludes to the plight of &#8220;the disappeared&#8221; (i.e., Chileans who did not fit with the state’s narrative under Pinochet). But it also invites us to ask who is shaping the narratives of our own time and place. As a potent indictment of the multiple-choice test, the book will also appeal to students still smarting from poor grades in end-of-year exams.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://geni.us/LdSPH"><i>The Book of Lost Things</i></a> by John Connolly</strong></p>
<p>After the death of his mother, a grieving young boy enters a magical world. What follows is far from a children&#8217;s fairytale &#8212; bloody, decomposed corpses dot the narrative &#8212; but an allegory for loss, anger and redemption. Plus: there are wolves, beasts, knights, etc.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://geni.us/m3jHmfU"><i>Love and Trouble: A Midlife Reckoning</i></a> by Claire Dederer</strong></p>
<p>This erotically charged memoir grabbed me by the throat. Dederer reckons with the way her carefully crafted, mom-dad-and-two-kids idyll begins to crumble at mid-life (my favorite chapter is, “How to Have Sex with Your Husband of 15 Years”), as well as with her &#8220;chaotic past&#8221; as a &#8220;disastrous pirate slut of a girl.” This book is about being a woman, a wife, a mother, a daughter, a sexual being. Plus, as her experiments with form in various chapters show, she is a brilliant stylist.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://geni.us/8Dw5V"><i>The Bad-Ass Librarians of Timbuktu &#8212; And Their Race to Save the World’s Most Precious Manuscripts</i></a> by Joshua Hammer</strong></p>
<p>An unexpected and inspirational book. Timbuktu had been the center of Arabic scholarship in the Sahara for centuries, and in the 1990s, a meek, obsessive bibliophile named Abdel Vader Haidara amassed an unprecedented collection of hundreds of thousands of amazing ancient manuscripts. Along came Al Qaeda, taking over Timbuktu, intent on stealing, selling or burning every manuscript. Remarkably, Haidara and crew, with great risk and derring-do, manage to spirit all the manuscripts away to safety. The librarians prove mightier than the sword.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://geni.us/kFLpR"><i>Pocket Atlas of Remote Islands: Fifty Islands I Have Not Visited and Never Will</i></a> by Judith Schalansky</strong></p>
<p>Schalansky disproves dogeared advice to “write about what you know.” Born on what her publishers call “the wrong side of the Berlin Wall,” she learned to travel in her imagination and shares the fruits of her voyages in this wonderful little book. You might think of it as a collection of stories about explorers and castaways, or as a set of meditations on people and place. If you cannot afford to leave home this summer, open the book at random and allow Schalansky to be your guide. Unlike the book’s less fortunate characters, you are guaranteed safe passage home, but you will not return unchanged.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://geni.us/k98v1B"><i>The Handmaid’s Tale</i></a> by Margaret Atwood</strong></p>
<p>Many folks seeking knowledge focus on nonfiction, forgetting that fiction allows the reader to go beyond learning about an experience; it lets us feel the experience and the emotions connected to it. This 1985 novel has recently been revived as a TV series at a time when its lessons are likely more relevant than many of us would like to admit. I first read Atwood’s masterpiece as a first-year college student, not realizing the philosophies and truths within its pages would steer the whole of my career. If you are interested in feeling, and not just understanding, the severe impact of sexual and reproductive objectification of women, I’d start here.</p>

<p>I read this several years ago but &#8212; much like Orwell&#8217;s <i>1984 </i>&#8212; it seems particularly relevant given our current political morass.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://geni.us/ygA74Ul"><i>Behind the Beautiful Forevers: Life, Death, and Hope in a Mumbai Undercity</i></a> by Katherine Boo</strong></p>
<p>This is a beautifully written and painstakingly researched book that takes the reader deep into the lives of the fascinating, vulnerable and unbelievably resilient residents of one of Mumbai’s slums, Annawadi. Boo’s language is poetic and engaging, making this work of nonfiction a true can’t-put-it-down summer read. At the same time, the book offers critical social and political commentary concerning the unforeseen consequences of misguided or misinformed policy efforts that are aimed at mitigating the pervasive effects of systemic poverty.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://geni.us/ATFaPJx"><i>Kindred</i> </a>by Octavia E. Butler</strong></p>
<p>Butler is a masterful science fiction author. Here, she tells the tale of a Black woman who begins involuntarily traveling through time &#8212; to the antebellum South. Through the lens of sci-fi, a gripping, nuanced and often harrowing historical novel about life in the time of slavery unfurls. Published in 1979, <i>Kindred</i> reads like it could have been written for today&#8217;s political moment.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://geni.us/5XaFH"><i>Land of Open Graves: Living and Dying on the Migrant Trail</i></a> by Jason de Leon</strong></p>
<p>Since the 1990s, US border enforcement policy has transformed the rugged Sonoran Desert of Arizona into a killing ground. Against a backdrop of the historical, political and economic context of border crossing, de Leon evocatively captures the human experience of border-crossers and the federal policies that shape their lives and deaths.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of talk about the opioid crisis these days, but what&#8217;s missing from the statistics is the human story, the understanding of why people are making the choices they do. This novel, which focuses on Kentucky in the 1990s, gave me that understanding.

<p>This book is a fascinating exploration of one of the most radical experiments the world has ever seen &#8212; China’s population control policy &#8212; and its consequences, which include a vast gender imbalance and a rapidly aging workforce. Interlaced with her personal and often humorous quest to conceive a child, Fong tells unforgettable stories of resilience and ingenuity in Chinese families, without shying away from the horrors of forced abortions and sterilizations under the policy. This book is a compelling must-read, as attempts to control women&#8217;s reproductive rights are still ongoing throughout the world.</p>

<p>Recent elections revealed a shifting electoral landscape in the US shaped by an increasingly polarized electorate and the rise and success of the Tea Party. Through hundreds of conversations in rural Louisiana about family, community and environment, sociologist Hochschild illuminates the worldview and philosophy of grassroots supporters of the Tea Party.

<p>Johnson uses studies from military affairs to explore the various psychological and political sources of overconfidence. These lessons are important, of course, not just for world-changing cases of global conflict, but also for day-to-day decision making in business and personal affairs. Our tendency to overestimate our capabilities and to believe that we can control the future &#8212; what the author thinks of as “an integral part of the human psyche” &#8212; can be our downfall. In geopolitics, self-deception can lead to war; in business, it can lead to strategic blunders or worse. It’s important to test what we know, uncover what we don’t know, understand where we are prone to bias, and calibrate our goals and risk-taking.</p>

<p>Ecosystems and other complex adaptive systems upon which we all rely can have a fragility, a limit to their resilience, which it is important for us to understand. My collaborator, Simon Levin, a Princeton mathematical ecologist and National Science Medal winner, looks at the properties that make natural and managed ecosystems fragile or resilient, and he derives a set of principles for creating and maintaining enduring systems. The consequences for preserving ecosystem viability are profound, especially right now with the teetering political unity to address climate change. And the principles he writes about apply beyond ecology and have important implications for the durability of business models, companies and business ecosystems.</p>

<p>This is a lyrical, explorative, non-linear journey of the concept of emergent strategy. Brown explains at the outset that the book is meant to be perused, returned to and jumped around in. There are essays, poems, exercises, dialogues, assessments, facilitations, even a playlist. It&#8217;s a book for people interested in radical social change, who are willing to think expansively about what the future could look like, or are in need of help doing that kind of thinking.</p>

<p>Alexander, Obama&#8217;s inaugural poet, wrote an absolutely heart-wrenching memoir after the death of her husband. By reading the book you come to care about her, you come to care about him, and you come to care about their whole family &#8212; her loss becomes your loss. You mourn alongside her.</p>

<p>This is one of the most beautiful memoirs I&#8217;ve ever read. A poet writes about the blinding shock of unexpected death (her husband died on a treadmill in her home) in magically heartfelt prose. Somehow, despite being about death, it&#8217;s desperately hopeful. No words are wasted, and every moment is precious in this book and this life.</p>

<p>Across the globe, cultural tourism is a well-established and growing industry as indigenous people showcase aspects of their culture and lives to travelers. It provides rich opportunities for greater cross-cultural knowledge, enhanced understanding of diverse lives and better insights into human universals, but it also exists against a historical context of colonialism that shapes people’s interactions today. In her witty memoir from the frontlines of an Alaska tour company, Bunten delves into these important complexities.</p>

<p>I picked up this book by the father of Jeffrey Dahmer for 50 cents on vacation, more out of morbid curiosity than any noble motivation. I was quickly swept up in deep self-reflection and truly great writing. Dahmer is not here to turn his son&#8217;s infamy into a book deal (or, at least, he doesn&#8217;t seem to be); he is here to explore whether his own worst qualities might have been passed onto his son and whether the worst parts of all of us might be reflected in the maddest among us. More than a sad read, it’s a deep and thoughtful one.</p>

<p>At a time when sexual misconduct, from campus rape to the actions of world leaders, is perpetually in the news, reading this recounting by Thordis and Tom of the darkest moment in both their lives is courageous, illuminating and ultimately redemptive.

<p>Following the fall of apartheid, psychologist Gobodo-Madikizela, who was working for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, is given a nightmare assignment: to spend hours and hours interviewing and trying to understand the jailed Eugene de Kok, who oversaw the torture and death squads of the regime and who arguably had the most apartheid-era blood on his hands. But rather than being a monstrous archetype, de Kok turned out to be a human, for better or worse. While hugs don&#8217;t ensue by the end amid stirring violins, Gobodo-Madikizela is repeatedly blindsided by finding little slivers of human connection with the man. An &#8220;if it can happen with them, it can happen anywhere&#8221; kind of story.</p>

It&#8217;s very funny, and Jahren&#8217;s quirky personality shines through her telling of almost unbelievable events, her deep struggles with depression and imposter syndrome and the friends, students and family who support her during her wild journey. Her life is an inspiration to scientists everywhere, and this book is a beautiful and hilarious love letter to science and the natural world.</p>

<p>This book is a profound attempt to analyze how humans react when all that is familiar to them is forcibly stripped from them. How do they &#8212; or can they &#8212; maintain their dignity and sense of worth? Levi’s autobiography of his year of incarceration in Auschwitz and the way he managed to save himself from a morass of indignity and destruction rightfully ranks as one of the classics of the 20th century.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://geni.us/YIKM4B5"><i>The Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life, One Night at a Time</i></a> by Arianna Huffington</strong></p>
<p>As a sleep researcher, I found this book interesting, engaging and well-researched. Using a combination of storytelling from her own personal experience as well as numerous examples of the consequences of sleep loss from leading sleep scientists, this book provides a compelling and highly readable case for why, as a society, we need to wake up to the importance of sleep.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://geni.us/jGLE"><i>Love in the Time of Colic: The New Parent’s Guide to Getting It On Again</i></a> by Ian Kerner and Heidi Raykeil</strong></p>
<p>I love gifting this book to new parents. It’s a humorous, frank, science-based discussion of how parenthood need not be at odds with sexuality and romance. It’s an incredibly relatable and quick read because which parent has time to read?</p>

<p>A very simple book with a very deep and complex message for innovators, entrepreneurs and even parents. No matter how elegant or precise you want to make your project &#8212; be it a book, a product or even a public policy &#8212; recognize that rough and imprecise elements are actually as important as the polished and smooth aspects.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://geni.us/GL8Z3iS"><i>Expecting Better: Why the Conventional Pregnancy Wisdom Is Wrong &#8212; and What You Really Need to Know</i></a> by Emily Oster</strong></p>
<p>Our culture insists on not resting until every expectant parent is a strung-out, anxious mess. This easy-to-read yet data-driven book is the antidote. Oster, an economist highly trained in interpreting information, guides readers through the science of pregnancy so they can take a step back from the hysteria and make fact-based, informed decisions.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://geni.us/wHn15HS"><i>The Stars: A New Way to See Them</i></a> by H.A. Rey</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to learn star constellations from the time I was a young kid, but star-gazing charts always befuddled me. I couldn&#8217;t square the weird scribbles on the paper in my hand with Leo the Lion or Ursa Major the Bear above me. But then someone gave me this book, and Rey (the illustrator of the <i>Curious George</i> books) redraws the lines so that yes, Taurus looks like the bull and the Corona Borealis is clearly a crown. You also learn the accompanying myths, as well as some simple astronomy. Go outside with this book and your friends, and watch the night sky suddenly make sense.</p>

<p><a href="http://geni.us/VTLSf"><i><strong>The Safety Godmothers: The ABCs of Awareness, Boundaries and Confidence for Teens </strong></i></a><strong>by Ellen Snortland and Lisa Gaeta</strong></p>
<p>Every one of us, especially teens, could benefit from learning about self-defense. The authors share their expertise in violence prevention with a series of readable “clips” that contain personal safety tips as well as verbal exercises. Some books are a great summer read. Some books can save your life. This rare book is both.</p>

<p>The author of this book traveled to 15 countries to interview cancer survivors and healers. It’s a great read for anyone who is dealing with cancer or who wants to prevent its recurrence.</p>

<h2><b>When you want to learn from the past </b></h2>
<p><strong><a href="http://geni.us/HP7p"><i>Alexander Hamilton</i></a> by Ron Chernow</strong></p>
<p>Chernow writes an engaging story that exposes a fascinating life in an enjoyable and educational way. I found Hamilton&#8217;s life to be inspiring, and was struck by how influential he was in shaping the US.</p>

<p>This is a delightful exploration of how games, music, fashion and other fripperies shaped the modern world. A desire for purple dye led to early global exploration; it was a computer game that kick-started the hacker revolution; and demand for cotton fashions helped spark the Industrial Revolution. It’s a book about fun that&#8217;s fun to read.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://geni.us/BwEIC7"><i>The Tragic Sense of Life: Ernst Haeckel and the Struggle over Evolutionary Thought</i></a> by Robert J. Richards</strong></p>
<p>What do Charles Darwin and the dancer Isadora Duncan have in common? They both shared and deeply admired a mutual friend: the German biologist Ernst Haeckel. Richards writes a truly engrossing story about Haeckel, a product of 19th-century Romanticism, who was part artist and part scientist and who became through his own insight and conviction the epicenter of a powerful clash between science and religion. Even 100 years later, the repercussions of his actions continue to be felt in today’s scientific, popular, religious, even political discourse.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://v"><i>Cartographies of Time: A History of the Timeline</i></a> by Daniel Rosenberg and Anthony Grafton</strong></p>
<p>This is another book that I pick up often. Its dry title belies the wonder you get when looking through it. The history of the timeline is a beautiful meditation on how we think about and visualize time, as well as the cultural and technological contexts that influence our aesthetics. It&#8217;s like the history of remembering history. The text is more academic than whimsical, but I love to understand the stories by just looking at the diagrams and timelines. One of my favorites is Clarence Larkin&#8217;s diagrams of the bible, especially the book of Revelation, truly extraordinary images that attempt to make plain the human condition through Christian stories.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://geni.us/hKYK3"><i>The Victorian Internet: The Remarkable Story of the Telegraph and the Nineteenth Century&#8217;s On-line Pioneers</i> </a>by Tom Standage</strong></p>
<p>This book is a riveting history of the telegraph. What I love about it is how it demonstrates that our present-day fears and hopes about new communications technologies are more familiar than we might think.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://geni.us/WnH0"><i>JFK: A Vision for America</i></a> edited by Stephen Kennedy Smith and Douglas Brinkley</strong></p>
<p>This beautifully photographed book came out this year, to mark JFK’s 100th birthday, and it’s a vivid tribute to his words and his dedication to the American ideals that he so movingly inspired through his speeches. It’s a fun read or coffee table book that profiles the “idealist without illusions.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://geni.us/mqlF"><i>The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt’s New World</i></a> by Andrea Wulf</strong></p>
<p>Wulf tells the story of one of history&#8217;s greatest minds, Alexander von Humboldt, in his context: his time, place, personal and professional struggles, as well as his exciting adventures and discoveries. By doing so she brings him to life, but she also transported me back to an era when the world was still a vast unknown. I’ve read it a few times now, and each time I am left impressed by the interconnectedness of our world and I’m hungry to keep exploring it.</p>
<p>&#8212; <i>Andrés Ruzo (<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/andres_ruzo_the_mythical_boiling_river_of_the_amazon">TED Talk: The boiling river of the Amazon</a>)</i></p>
<p>In a crisp and engaging narrative, the author paints a comprehensive, richly textured landscape of the times and the impact the times exerted on the thinking and enunciation of scientific principles by Alexander von Humboldt. Von Humboldt’s life is as fascinating as the breadth of his contributions to the modern understanding of life in our planet.</p>
